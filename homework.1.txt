DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NULL AND UNDEFINED

    NULL
 Null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.

For example;

var demo = null;
alert(demo); //shows null
alert(typeof demo); //shows object


   UNDEFINED
Whereas undefined means a variable has been declared, but no value has been assigned a value.

For example;

var demo;
alert(demo); //shows undefined 
alert(typeof demo); //shows undefined

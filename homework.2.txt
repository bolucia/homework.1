DECLARATION

Declaration, generally, refers to the introduction of a new name in the program.
For example, you can declare a new function by describing it's "signature":
void xyz();

or declare an incomplete type:
class klass;
struct ztruct;

and last but not least, to declare an object:
int x;

It is described, in the C++ standard.


DEFINITION

A definition is a definition of a previously declared name (or it can be both definition and declaration).

For example:
int x;
void xyz() {...}
class klass {...};
struct ztruct {...};
enum { x, y, z };

Specifically the C++ standard defines it.

INITIALIZATION

Initialization refers to the "assignment" of a value, at construction time.
For a generic object of type T, it's often in the form:
T x = i;

but in C++ it can be:
T x(i);

or even:
T x {i};
with C++11.
